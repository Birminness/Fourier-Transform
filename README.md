# Fourier-Transform
My first arithmetical project in Verilog. The program calculating floating point Fourier Transform: real and imaginary parts and amplitudes and also
mathematical expected value of amplitude. The program is speeding up calculation by 16 times with external lookup tables.
Amplitudes are calculated by Babylonian method of square root calculation
